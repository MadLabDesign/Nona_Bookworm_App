Nona Creative has presentended an assignment to think UX, Design IU and build as a Frontend Responsive App.

______________

### Project Descrition:

##### PART 1 - Process and UX/UI thinking:
Design the user interface for the book recommendation section of an online book shop. This can be presented as a sketch, a wireframe or rough design. The UI elements should be clear.


##### USER STORY:
A user should be able to enter information about what they feel like reading so that the app can give them a recommendation based on the user's input.

The user should be able to select genre and sub-genre and they should be able to tell the app how much they are willing to spend. 
Other inputs should be added to further filter the recommendations.


______________


##### PART 2 - Code:
Create a single page layout using the languages of your choice, that contains at least these elements:

    Desktop nav with dummy links
    Mobile nav with dummy links
    Search bar - does not need to work
    Basic contact form - does not need to work
    Content should be 2 column layout on desktop
    Use some content from this page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Velvet_Underground_%26_Nico


I am using React Native JS with Material-Ui0.1 and Next.JS fo handel the integration mess.


#### Running the project

$yarn start
$yarn 
$yarn dev
